## About Learnin' Birds

This is a clone of the popular mobile game [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/) originally by Dong Nguyen, but with an added mode where you can watch an AI "learn" how to play the game instead of playing it yourself.

The idea to use some form of machine learning to play Flappy Bird is not new -- I was inspired by the work a few folks on YouTube -- but all of the neural net and genetic algorithm code (along with all of the art) is my own creation.

You can find a current version of the app [here](https://learnin-birds.herokuapp.com/). Enjoy :)
